# Git Global ðŸŒŽ

## Motivation
Open-source hackers, coders, and programmers form a community that spans the whole inhabited world. That's over 200 countries, countless ethnicities, and more than 7000 languages. Yet, a large portion of open-source code is documented and explained only in the dominant language of the computer science world: English. Moreover, Github does not provide multilingual search capabilities on their popular source code platform.

This imposes an extraordinary burden on technical creatives engaged in work that could benefit the world. Git Global bridges the gap and allows them to benefit from the world's work. 

## Usage
Enter the Github username of an organization or developer into Git Global to see a list of all the READMEs in their public Github repos translated into your native tongue. Search for keywords and topics using Git Global's multilingual search functionality.

## License
Git Global is available for commercial and non-commercial use under the terms of the MIT license.

## Contributing Guidelines
### What do I need to know to help?
If you are looking to help to with a code contribution Git Global is built in Python using Streamlit. If you don't feel ready to make a code contribution yet, no problem! Check out the documentation for a deeper understanding of the current codebase. 

If you are interested in making a code contribution and would like to learn more about the technologies that we use, check out the list below.

### How do I make a contribution?
Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in the in our project? Here's a quick rundown!

1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.
2. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under your-GitHub-username/repository-name.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git.
4. Create a new branch for your fix using git checkout -b branch-name-here.
5. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
6. Use git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.
7. Use git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here" to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.
8. Push the changes to the remote repository using git push origin branch-name-here.
9. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
10. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so "Added more log outputting to resolve #4352".
11. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!
12. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
13. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
14. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!
